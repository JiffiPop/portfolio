                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    The summer after my junior year, I began working for my professor at Syracuse University's Bionics 
                    and Control Systems Laboratory with several other students.
                    &nbsp;The premise of the research was to develop a method where patients suffering from lower-limb paralysis, 
                    (specifically those who suffered from a stroke or traumatic injury to the spinal cord), could initially
                    exercise their muscles after being bedridden for a significant amount of time.
                    &nbsp;This could potentially allow patients to gain the strength to walk after multiple iterations of 
                    this assisted exercise by exploiting the muscles they already have.
                    &nbsp;This is also referred to as gait rehabilitation.
                    <br><br>
                    There are two main steps for this process.
                    &nbsp;The first step is to utilize the stationary bike.
                    &nbsp;The bike itself features a motor connected into the drivechain system,
                    and cloth electrodes that are placed on the patient's thighs.
                    &nbsp;In short, the way this works is the electrodes involuntarily contract the patient's muscles and forces
                    them to pedal.
                    &nbsp;This works in conjunction with the motor to assist the pedalling motion as the electrodes alone are 
                    not enough to do so.
                    &nbsp;Exercising with the bike for multiple sessions can build enough muscle to the point where the patient
                    can walk utilizing the lower-limb exoskeleton suit.

        <h3>Exoskeleton Suit Design</h3>
        <p>
Once a substantial amount of the patient's muscle has been built the exoskeleton can be used.
&nbsp;This is where I came in.
&nbsp;My main assignment was to design and fabricate the mechanical frame for an exoskeleton suit.
&nbsp;One of the major requirements was that it would be adjustable such that it can fit 99% of people according to a data sheet on sizes of humans in different areas.
&nbsp;The design also needed to be comfortable yet firmly attached, include rotary encoders, and include cable attachment points with force sensors.
&nbsp;Shown below are the results of my work.
